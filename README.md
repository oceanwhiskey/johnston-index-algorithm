# Abstract
Power indices can be very useful to reveal the actual power of voters in a voting system. In weighted majority games each voter has a weight and the overall vote is "yes", if the sum of weights of all "yes"-voters is greater or equal the quota.
In this paper I propose an algorithm for the computation of the Johnston power index in weighted majority games.
The presented algorithm computes the index in pseudo-polynomial time $\mathcal{O}(n^3q)$ for all players, where $n$ is the number of players and $q$ is the quota of the weighted majority game. The memory usage is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(nq)$.
